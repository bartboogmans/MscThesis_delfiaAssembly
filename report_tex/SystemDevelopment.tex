\chapter{System Development}
\label{chap:sysDevelopent}
This chapter describes development of a multi-vessel platforming system. Major considerations for developing vessel-platform systems that are self-assembling and show collaboration and coordinated motion control as described in Chap. \ref{chap:sysAnalysis} are used for decisionmaking on design and implementation. The multi-vessel-system notation and approach to predict dynamic behavior of a combined waterborne structure as described in Chap. \ref{chap:stateDescription} are used to develop the control algorythm in this chapter. 
The first part of this chapter shows conceptual, high level design choices, such as network topology, control approach and subdivision of the entire system into modular subsystems. 
The second part of this chapter focusses on implementation of the design by giving information of the  technologies, hardware and software structure that give physical form to the distinguished subsystems.
