\chapter{System Analysis}
\label{chap:sysAnalysis}

% Goal of chapter:
This chapter formulates characteristics of the two considered systems and their combination, to answer subquestion 2:

\begin{itemize}
\item What characteristics does a vessel system have that integrates automated assembly with configuration dependent control?
\end{itemize}

Answering this question will bring better understanding of the meaning of "a system that performs self-assembly" and "a multi-robot-assembly performing collaborative and coordinated control". The aim is to look beyond the design solutions from the projects described in the previous secion, and create a broader view on the design spectrum. 

% Structure of chapter
The first section explores characteristics of systems performing automated assembly (section \ref{analysisReconfiguration}) and configuration dependent control (section \ref{analysisConfigAdaptation}).
This chapter concludes by mapping system characteristics as a result of integrating both behaviors (section \ref{analysisCombined}). 

This section uses various external sources to aid formulation of characteristics, some of which have been discussed in the previous chapter. 
The overall approach is to distinct generalized system characteristics as well as a narrowed down set of solutions that can be considered more feasible to perform in commercial applications, also taking into account design choices of other projects.
